Feature: Filter Refiner, Filter by range attribute
	As a user, I want to work with numeric attributes, filter by their values, ranges.
	We assume, that all attributes with ranges have the same behavior.

	Scenario Outline: Filter by range, middle - XL dataset
		Given the Filter Refiner for the "xl_PGP3140_wgs_NIST-4_2" was open
		When user clicks the <Attribute Name>
		And enters the minimum value of range <Minimum Value>
		And enters the maximum value of range <Maximum Value>
		And clicks the "Add" button to apply the filter
		Then filter should be applied
		And the range <Minimum Value> < <Attribute Name> <  <Maximum Value> should be displayed in the right part of the screen
		And number of variants should be equal to <Variants Number>
		And the "View Variants" dialog can be open
		And the "Full List" view should be disabled
