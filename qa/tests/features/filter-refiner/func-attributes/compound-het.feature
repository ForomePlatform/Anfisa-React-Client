Feature: Filter Refiner, Filter by Compound_Het
	As a user, I want to have an ability to filter variants by Compound Het

	Scenario Outline: Secondary dataset 
		Given the Filter Refiner for the "PGP3140_wgs_panel_hl" was open
		When the user clicks the "Compound_Het" attribute
		And  selects the <Compound Het Value> in the drop-down
		And  clicks the "Add" button
		Then Compound_Het should be added to the right part of the page
		And variants list should be filtered by <Compound Het Value>
		And number of variants should be equal to <Variants Number>

		Examples:
		| <Compound Het Value>         | <Variants Number> |
		| shared transcripts           | 0                 |
		| shared gene                  | 260               |
		| non-intersecting transcripts | 248               |

	Scenario Outline: Secondary dataset - Go to Main Table
		Given the Filter Refiner for the "PGP3140_wgs_panel_hl" was open
		When the user clicks the "Compound_Het" attribute
		And  selects the <Compound Het Value> in the drop-down
		And  clicks the "Add" button
		And the filter is applied
		And user clicks the "Apply" button
		Then the "Main Table" page should be open
		And number of variants equal to <Variants Number>

		Examples:
		| <Compound Het Value>         | <Variants Number> |
		| shared transcripts           | 0                 |
		| shared gene                  | 260               |
		| non-intersecting transcripts | 248               |

	Scenario Outline: Primary dataset 
		Given the Filter Refiner for the "xl_PGP3140_wgs_NIST-4_2" was open
		When the user clicks the "Compound_Het" attribute
		And  selects the <Compound Het Value> in the drop-down
		And  clicks the "Add" button
		Then the "Add" button should be disabled
		And the filter should not be added
		And the <Validaion message> should be displayed

		Examples:
		| <Compound Het Value>         | <Validaion message>       |
		| shared transcripts           | Too heavy condition       |
		| shared gene                  | Improper approx mode gene |
		| non-intersecting transcripts | Too heavy condition       |

	Scenario Outline: Clear button
		Given the Filter Refiner for the "PGP3140_wgs_panel_hl-4_2" was open
		When the user clicks the "Compound_Het" attribute
		And selects the <Compound Het Value> in the drop-down
		And clicks the "Add" button
		And the filter is applied
		And the user clicks the "Clear" button
		Then filter should be cleared

		Examples:
		| <Compound Het Value>         | 
		| shared transcripts           | 
		| shared gene                  | 
		| non-intersecting transcripts |
